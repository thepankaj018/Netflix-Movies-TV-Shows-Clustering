# Netflix-Movies-TV-Shows-Clustering
1.The goal of the project was to analyze and cluster Netflix movies and TV shows based on their genre, director,cast,country and description.

2.The project used a dataset of Netflix movies and TV shows.The dataset contained information such as the title, director, cast, country, date added, release year, rating, and genre of each movie and TV show.

3.The project first performed data cleaning and preprocessing on the dataset. This included handling missing values, converting data types, and creating new features..

4.The project then used unsupervised machine learning techniques such as k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering to cluster the movies and TV shows based on their genre,director,cast,country and description.

5.The project also developed a content-based recommender system that recommends movies and TV shows based on their similarity to other movies and TV shows.

6.The content-based recommender system used features such as genre, director, cast to compute the similarity between movies and TV shows. The similarity was measured using cosine similarity, which measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors in a high-dimensional space.

7.Finally the project demonstrated the usefulness of unsupervised machine learning techniques for analyzing and clustering large datasets of movies and TV shows, as well as the effectiveness of content-based recommender systems for providing personalized recommendations based on user preferences.
